      <div class="bio">
        <p>At 33 years old, Im a proud wife and a seasoned digital marketing professional with over a decade of experience in digital promotion and strategy. I currently work at Blavity, Inc., where I contribute to innovative marketing efforts that amplify Black culture and creativity. My educational background includes a Bachelor's degree in Mass Communications from Savannah State University and a Masters degree in Higher Education. Now, Im expanding my expertise even further as I pursue my second Masters in Digital Strategy from the University of Florida—a step that aligns perfectly with my passion for connecting audiences through compelling digital content.
Outside of work and school, I have a strong creative side that fuels my love for video editing and graphic design. Whether its producing social content or bringing a visual story to life, I find joy in using digital tools to communicate and inspire. I'm a lifelong learner who enjoys reading and discovering new skills, and the next item on my personal development list is diving deeper into web design. As I continue to grow in my career, Im excited to add this skill to my toolkit and further position myself as a versatile leader in the digital marketing space.</p>
